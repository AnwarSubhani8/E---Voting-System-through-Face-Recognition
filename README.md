# E-Voting System through Face Recognition

Welcome to the E-Voting System through Face Recognition project! This project aims to provide a secure and convenient method for voting using face recognition technology.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**: Used for feature extraction from facial images.
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Employed for classification of facial features.
- **PyQt5**: Utilized for building the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features üöÄ
- **Face Recognition**: Allows voters to securely authenticate their identity through facial recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The PyQt5 GUI ensures an intuitive and easy-to-use voting experience.
- **Secure Authentication**: Ensures the integrity and security of the voting process by authenticating voters through facial features.
- **Efficient Processing**: HOG and KNN algorithms provide accurate and efficient face recognition.
